Rbots Development Kit - final release
-------------------------------------

This development kit is designed to be used in conjunction with the tutorial.
The tutorial describes each of the components in detail and how to
incorporate it into other levels. Please do not attempt to use this kit without
first reading through the tutorial.

Unzip the files to your project directory, overwriting any existing Rbots files.
If you have modified any of the files that are included in this release, you
will need to manually add those changes to the new Rbots files. ie: templates,
items, jkstrings, cogstrings etc.
