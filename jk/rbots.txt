Rbots final release
-------------------
Development staff: Raynar
Additional code  : Hell Raiser

What is Rbots?
--------------
Rbots is a project to create a 'bot' for Jedi Knight. A bot is a computer
controlled player for multiplayer games. It should react and play just like a
human player - it has health, shields, limited ammo & weapons and when it dies
it will 'respawn' to allow the game to continue. Multiple bots will battle
amongst themselves as well as any number of human players. 

Requirements
------------
* Patch Commander - http://www.jediknight.net/commander/

Patch Commander is necessary to use force powers and other enhancements including
the use of 'hotkeys' with Rbots. 

Installation
------------
Unzip the file and copy the 'rbots-jk.gob' to the episodes directory. In most
cases this will be 'C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Jedi Knight\Episode'. Copy the
'rbots-patch.gob' & 'rbots-patch-nohotkeys.gob' to Patch Commander patch
directory. In most cases this will be 'C:\Program Files\LucasArts\Jedi Knight\JKPatch'.
Run Patch Commander, in JK mode, and activate the 'rbots-patch.gob' patch. Now run JK
from Patch Commander.

* If you wish to use third party mods with Rbots, activate the 'rbots-patch-nohotkeys.gob'
  instead.

Upgrading from previous versions

  situation, rather than just using the 'biggest' gun it has

* Bots will dodge incoming projectiles based on difficulty

Teamplay Mode
-------------
In order to play Rbots in Teamplay mode, make sure you enable 'Teamplay' in
the options. You can also change teams just as you would in a 'normal'
Teamplay game.

Add/Removing Bots
-----------------
Enter setup mode, go to 'Controls' then 'Keyboard'. Assign the hotkey you want
to use for altering the number of bots. You can now use this function at
anytime during gameplay. The included levels are set to 4 bots by default. Press
the hotkey until you have the number of bots you want, it will cycle through
the maximum number of bots allowed before returning to no bots at all. When
bots are removed, they are first killed - this is to ensure proper conditions
when the bot is restarted.

Botcam
------
As per Add/Removing Bots, set up a new hotkey to use. Anytime during play you
can select either of this new mode. Botcam will change the camera view to a
3rd person view of one of the bots - allowing you to watch exactly what the bot
does in any given circumstance. Pressing the hotkey repeatedly will cycle
through all the bots currently in the game before finally switching off.

Reporting Problems
------------------
As this is the final version, any reported bugs may never be fixed. However it may
help anyone who has decided to take over the project at a later time.

If you find any problems with Rbots, please refer to the 'Known Problems' list
on the website. If the problem is not listed, please post a bug report on the
Rbots forum - there's a link to it from the Rbots website http://rbots.massassi.net
Please include a complete description of the problem along with as much information
as you can about what you (and the bots) were doing at the time the problem
occurred.

Adding Rbots to your own levels
-------------------------------
There is a separate version of Rbots available which allows you to create your own
Rbots levels. First you will need the Rbots SDK - this has all the files you need.
There is also a very comprehensive set of tutorial available. Download both the SDK
and tutorials and follow the instructions. Both will be available where you downloaded
this file, or from the Rbots website http://rbots.massassi.net
